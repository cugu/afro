# afro (APFS file recovery) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cugu/afro.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cugu/afro)

afro can parse APFS volumes. It can also recover deleted files from APFS that other tools do not find.

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/cugu/afro
    cd afro
    python3 setup.py install

## Usage

AFRO needs to know the start of the APFS partition. The partition can be found out as described below.

### Export partition

AFRO needs to know the start of the APFS container, you can find the start of the APFS container using mmls from the [sleuthkit](https://github.com/sleuthkit/sleuthkit).

    mmls test/wsdf.dmg

This results in:

``` text
GUID Partition Table (EFI)
Offset Sector: 0
Units are in 512-byte sectors

      Slot      Start        End          Length       Description
000:  Meta      0000000000   0000000000   0000000001   Safety Table
001:  -------   0000000000   0000000039   0000000040   Unallocated
002:  Meta      0000000001   0000000001   0000000001   GPT Header
003:  Meta      0000000002   0000000033   0000000032   Partition Table
004:  000       0000000040   0000195319   0000195280   disk image
005:  -------   0000195320   0000195352   0000000033   Unallocated
```

You have to search for the APFS partition in this list. In the example above 004 is the APFS partition which starts at offset 40. `-o 40` needs to be included in the following commands. APFS is not recognized by the sleuth kit so the description is only `disk image`.

### Export files

All files of an apfs image can be extracted using the following command:

    afro -o 40 -e files test/wsdf.dmg

The exported files are saved in a folder named after the image with the suffix '.extracted'. Because APFS images can contain multiple volumes, each volume is extracted into a separate folder inside the '.extracted' folder. Each volume can contain multiple versions of the file system which are stored in separate numbered folders. Inside those folders two folders exists 'private-dir' and 'root'. Those folders are not visible to the user, but exist on every APFS file system.

Example:

    wsdf.dmg.carve_apsb.extracted
    ├─ wsdf                  <- First volume
    │  ├─ 5                  <- First version
    │  │  ├─ private-dir
    │  │  └─ root            <- Root directory
    │  │     ├─ folder
    │  │     │  └─ foo.txt
    │  │     └─ bar.txt
    │  └─ 6                  <- Second version
    │     └─ …
    └─ my_volume_name        <- Second volume
       └─ …

### Create body file

To get an overview over the files a body file can be created:

    afro -o 40 -e bodyfile test/wsdf.dmg

More information on the body file format can be found in the [sleuthkit wiki](https://wiki.sleuthkit.org/index.php?title=Body_file). The body file can be further investigated using [mactime](https://wiki.sleuthkit.org/index.php?title=Mactime) and [Timeline Explorer](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/).
